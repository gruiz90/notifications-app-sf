# NotificationsAppEx

## Browser Notifications app to integrate with Salesforce Conversations

The user can setup what notifications the agent gets (New conversations, new message) and also custom audio for each notification type.
It uses Aura components as handlers of events by Conversations app, and is added as a hidden custom app in the Conversations console.
The setup is provided to the user with LWC and custom objects/settings.
